					<p>			Employment is a relationship between two parties regulating
						the provision of paid labour services. Usually based on a
						contract, one party, the employer, which might be a corporation, a
						not-for-profit organization, a co-operative, or any other entity,
						pays the other, the employee, in return for carrying out assigned
						work.
								 Employees work in return for wages, which can be paid on
						the basis of an hourly rate, by piecework or an annual salary,
						depending on the type of work an employee does, the prevailing
						conditions of the sector and the bargaining power between the
						parties. Employees in some sectors may receive gratuities, bonus
						payments or stock options. In some types of employment, employees
						may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits may include
						health insurance, housing, and disability insurance. Employment is
						typically governed by employment laws, organisation or legal
						contracts.</p>
